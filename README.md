# excel_to_post-plugin
A wordpress plugin where you can create multiple posts at the same time

Have you ever recieved thousands of posts at the same time from your boss telling you to upload them the your wordpress website?
well fear no more! excel_to_post is here!
excel to post basically turns an excel file that has been converted to csv. format. reads it and turns it each row into a post.
Here's how it works:
1. create the following titles on the first row (anything on the first row won't affect anything)
title     description
the title column is where you make the title of the post and description is what you want your post to say!

hope this makes your work hours shorter!
